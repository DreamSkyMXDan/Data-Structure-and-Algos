# Data-Structure-and-Algos
Code of me for some Data Structure and Algorithms.
Everyone is welcomed to refer to my code.

1. LRUCache <br />
A simple Least Recently Used(LRU) cache data structure is defined and implemented. <br /><br />
get(key): get the value of the key if the key exists in the cache otherwise return Integer.MIN_VALUE suppose the value in the cahce are all greater than Integer.MIN_VALUE; <br /> <br />
set(key, value): set the exisiting OR insert the new value to the cache when the cache hasn't reached its capacity. If the cache reached its capacity, the least recently used key should be erased first. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
